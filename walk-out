so, yesterday at the time of creating this message (1/31/26), there was a walk-out for all of the major high schools for my local city. my middle school made a private Instagram group chat for attending this walk-out, which, for my school at least, 30 students were at least going at best.
we protested against ICE and their killing(s), violence, and abuse. we went to a public park where it ended. i attended for around half, before my parents found out and took me home. i wasn't grounded, and everyone was safe (it was a peaceful protest, and school district police were there to make sure everyone was safe and no crimes were committed.)
if you have protested with us, agree with us, or show us any kind of support, we highly appreciate you. please, spread the message that ICE is abusing/killing people. thank you for reading this message!!
(i pulled both of my shoulder muscles from the protest... ouch!)
